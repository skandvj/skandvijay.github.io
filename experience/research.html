        <h1>Impact of Ad-Blockers and Anti-Trackers on Consumer</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>As a Research Assistant at Carnegie Mellon University, I contributed to a study titled 
               "The Effect of Ad-Blocking and Anti-Tracking on Consumer Behavior." This research aimed 
               to analyze the economic impact of digital privacy tools on consumer online behaviors and 
               purchasing outcomes.</p>
            <p>My responsibilities included:</p>
            <ul class="skills-list">
                <li>Recruiting and managing participants for a large-scale field experiment.</li>
                <li>Utilizing custom-developed tools to collect data on browsing behaviors and online purchases.</li>
                <li>Conducting data analysis to evaluate the effects of ad-blocking and anti-tracking on consumer engagement and purchasing decisions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Skills and Learning</h2>
            <p>Throughout this research experience, I developed and honed several key skills:</p>
            <ul class="skills-list">
                <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Proficient in analyzing large datasets to extract meaningful insights.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Proficiency:</strong> Experienced in using specialized software tools for data collection and analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Project Management:</strong> Effectively managed project timelines and participant communications.</li>
                <li><strong>Understanding of Consumer Behavior:</strong> Gained insights into how digital privacy tools influence consumer actions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>My vision is to leverage my background in data analysis and understanding of consumer behavior to 
               develop AI-driven products that prioritize user privacy and enhance user experience. I aim to bridge 
               the gap between technological innovation and ethical considerations, ensuring that advancements in AI 
               serve the best interests of consumers.</p>
